# Races

## Humans
* I like that they have the ability to tap into magic so they arne't totally defenseless

## Seed and Spore
* combined into one group because they seem very similar
* perhaps Seed and Spore are enemies
* I like that they are moulded into basically whatever is needed. (see [this](https://inhabitat.com/files/pook_in_chair_02.jpg))

## Deceptions and Spawn
* I like their stealth aspect
* Spawn should take after Deceptions and become a more lethal form. For example instead of relic armor their paws/hands become poisonous with the relics
