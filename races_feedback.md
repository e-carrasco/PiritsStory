# Races

## Humans
* I like that they have the ability to tap into magic so they aren't totally defenseless

## Seed and Spore
* combined into one group because they seem very similar
* perhaps Seed and Spore are enemies
* I like that they are moulded into basically whatever is needed. (see [this](https://inhabitat.com/files/pook_in_chair_02.jpg))

## Deceptions and Spawn
* I like their stealth aspect
* Spawn should take after Deceptions and become a more lethal form. For example instead of relic armor their paws/hands become infused with red relics(makes it difficult to stop bleeding)

## Hive
* I like they can take any shape to fight the problem and become large or small as well
* however they shouldn't also be capable of becoming educated
* alternative method to attain Bone Magics

## Skree'kaw
* Great overall
* I like that crafting leads to knowledge

## Blink
* overall like the concept
* I think they shouldn't be covered in fluff because fast and agile usually means aerodynamic
