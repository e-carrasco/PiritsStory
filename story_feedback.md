# Prologue

## Paragraph 1: Setting
I liked the setting it and seems like a really cool idea. Here's my take on it:
* grass made me think of the world as an orangish tone, including the mountains described up to the snow point see [this example](https://52f4e29a8321344e30ae-0f55c9129972ac85d6b1f4e703468e6b.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/products/pictures/123438.jpg) (unsure if this was your intention)
* I think this section you might want to expand.
* Hint at the existance of the two immortal races by bringing up their homeworlds at the end of the prologue eg : "At the start of this day the homeworld of two foreign creatures was just visible in the twilight sky." or something of that nature

## Paragraph 2: Advanced Bugs
I really like these creatures, they seem interesting with their ability to grow new limbs at the same time a little creepy.
Something really important that I especially liked about the two races that you chose was how their origins differ. What I mean by this is the way the the advanced bugs harness a physical property of nature.
My suggestions:
* I'm uncertain if the name purple relics is a placeholder, but I would like them to tap into something more sci-fi and less fantasy as they seem more technological due to growing to unnatural sizes, and prevent their own inward collapse. An example would be "... they have harnessed the [Higgs Boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) to manipulate matter at will.
