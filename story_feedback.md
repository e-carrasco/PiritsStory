# Prologue

## Paragraph 1: Setting
I liked the setting it and seems like a really cool idea. Here's my take on it:
* grass made me think of the world as an orangish tone, including the mountains described up to the snow point see [this example](https://52f4e29a8321344e30ae-0f55c9129972ac85d6b1f4e703468e6b.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/products/pictures/123438.jpg) (unsure if this was your intention)
* I think this section you might want to expand.
* Hint at the existance of the two immortal races by bringing up their homeworlds at the end of the prologue eg : "At the start of this day the homeworld of two foreign creatures was just visible in the twilight sky." or something of that nature
